## Single-state AVX2 Keccak-f[1600]

The local keccakf1600_avx2.h implementation adapts the seven-vector state
layout and round schedule from the XKCP KeccakP-1600 AVX2 implementation:

https://github.com/XKCP/XKCP/blob/master/lib/low/KeccakP-1600/AVX2/KeccakP-1600-AVX2.s

That XKCP source was generated from CRYPTOGAMS keccak1600-avx2.pl by Andy
Polyakov. baby-mlkem does not link XKCP or CRYPTOGAMS; the adapted intrinsics
implementation is compiled directly into the local core.

For XKCP/lib/low/KeccakP-1600/AVX2/KeccakP-1600-AVX2.s and XKCP/lib/low/KeccakP-1600/AVX512/KeccakP-1600-AVX512.s (potentially used in libXKCP, UnitTests, Benchmarks and KeccakSum, depending on the target platform):
