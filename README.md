# baby-mlkem

A toy implementation of ML-KEM (formaly knows as kyber), a Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism Standard ([FIPS203](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.FIPS.203)). This implementation is written in pure C with no external dependencies and is inspired by the blog post [Enough Polynomials and Linear Algebra to Implement Kyber](https://words.filippo.io/dispatches/kyber-math/).

## Test

To run tests for the implementation, execute the following command:

```bash
make test
```
